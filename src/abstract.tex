During my ISIMA third year studies, my work placement's aim was to incorporate an information technology services and software development company, assigned to a project to redesign an application for recruitment of seasonal.
\\

I have first examined customer needs and the existing solution, allowing the modeling the data model and the new application.

After the choice of technology, I developed the first functional version of the application.
This allowed the client to enumerate problems and propose ergonomic and functional improvements.

When then application was operational and deployed, I imported the data from the old to new database for effective transition.
